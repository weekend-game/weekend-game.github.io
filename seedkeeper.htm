			<p>My wife gave me the idea for this app. She grows tomatoes,
				peppers, and other plants as a hobby. She buys packets of seeds and
				grows a few plants of each variety. Often, she has leftover seeds,
				and sometimes we buy a variety but can't plant it that season. We're
				programmers, not farmers, and we have very little space to grow
				tomatoes.</p>
			<p>So, she accumulated several thousand packets of seeds, and we
				need to track them on our computer. A spreadsheet is impossible: the
				plant photos alone take up over 10 GB. A spreadsheet would do the
				job, but it would be incredibly slow. So my wife came up with a
				program to track these thousands of packets.</p>
			<p>
				And I need to practice with the database (<b>Apache Derby</b>), try
				out a development new type of user interface (<b>Tabbed document
					interface</b>), a new UI development kit (<b>JavaFX</b>), and figure
				out how to create such a program in a few hundred lines. At the same
				time, the conciseness of the code must not compromise the user
				interface and the necessary functionality.
			</p>

				Eclipse was used for development. The project is located here: <a
