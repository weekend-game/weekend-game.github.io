				<b>Java (11)</b>, <b>Swing</b> (Single document interface), <a
					class="link" target="_blank"
					href="https://github.com/weekend-game/bankviewer/">BankViewer</a>
				is used as an application template.
			</p>
			<p>So, I created a bank statement viewer. You can create viewers
				for many other things using a similar approach. But these are just
				viewers. And if you try to create an editor, you will find that you
				have to solve many problems. Now I am not creating some unusual
				editor, I am not creating an editor better than others, I am not
				trying to compete with anyone. I am researching what problems need
				to be solved and looking for solutions.</p>
			<p>This is a regular text editor that allows you to edit simple
				text files. It has kept all the features already available in
				BankViewer. But it not only opens existing files, but also creates
				new ones, saves edited text, makes sure of that you do not lose lose
				the result of editing, intelligently and sensibly manages the
				activity of the "Edit" menu items. It can not only search for text,
				but also replace one text with another. It allows you to set a
				convenient font size, use a monospace font if it is convenient in
				any situation.</p>
			<p>
				Eclipse was used for development. The project is located here: <a
					class="link" target="_blank"
					href="https://github.com/weekend-game/weekendtexteditor/">https://github.com/weekend-game/weekendtexteditor/</a>

				This text editor is based on the bank statement viewer and inherits
				its entire user interface (<a class="link" target="_blank"
					href="https://weekend-game.github.io/bankviewer.htm#HowToUse">
					see here</a> ). Of course, the opened file is now displayed as a text
				file, not as a table. New features have been added.
			</p>
			<p>The "File" menu now includes the following options: "Create,"
				"Save," and "Save As." They work the same way as in all programs.</p>
			<p>The "Edit" menu now includes the "Undo" and "Redo" options.
				The "Cut" and "Copy" text editing options are active if a text
				fragment is selected, while the "Paste" option is active only if a
				copy has been made.</p>
			<p>A "Replace" option has been added. When selected, a dialog box
				appears where you can specify a search string, a replacement string,
				whether to select case, and specify the search direction. The "Find
				Next" button works the same as in the search window. The "Replace"
				button replaces the found string with the replacement string. The
				"Replace All" button will replace all instances of the search string
				with the replacement string.</p>
			<p>The "View" menu now includes the following options: "Use
				monospaced font," "Enlarge font," "Decrease font," and "Default font
				size."</p>

				The main class of the application is the <b>WeekendTextEditor</b>
				class. It contains the static main() method for launching the
				program. Its constructor creates everything necessary for operation.
			</p>
			<p>Since this text editor is based on a bank statement viewer, it
				uses the same objects for its operation. You can learn more about
				them here. But there are also some new features.</p>
			<p>
				The same JEditorPane is used for editing text, but it is now
				separated into a separate <b>Editor</b> class, which implements many
				functions. This class contains methods for changing the font and its
				size, methods for supporting the "Undo" and "Redo" menu items,
				methods for selecting, copying, and pasting text, and some other
				functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>Replacer</b> and <b>ReplacerFrame</b> classes are similar to
				Finder and FinderFrame, but are designed to perform not only
				searching but also replacing text.
			</p>
			<p>You can learn more about the program's operation by
				downloading the project, opening it in Eclipse, reading the class
				code, making changes, running the program, and watching the results.</p>
