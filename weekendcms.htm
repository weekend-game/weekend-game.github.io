				<b>Java (11)</b>, <b>Swing</b>, several classes taken from previous
				projects (<b>GBL</b>, <b>Loc</b>, <b>Mes</b>, <b>Proper</b>)
			</p>
			<p>I ran into a problem. On August 23, 2025, while vacationing on
				the beautiful Mediterranean coast in Side, I designed and
				implemented a prototype of this website. I planned to publish full
				descriptions of all my projects there, and everything generally
				worked out. I came up with a bilingual homepage, decided to dedicate
				one page per language to each project (repository), and started
				blogging. But life goes on. New project ideas emerge, and they need
				their own page on the website. Adding one new page requires changes
				to all pages of the site. Of course, this is possible, but why?</p>
			<p>I created my own CMS (content management system) to manage my
				website. Problem solved! Of course, I could use a ready-made one,
				but which one? And how long will it take me to master it? Is it
				possible to create a website exactly as I envisioned, on the
				Mediterranean coast or something similar? So, the job is done: the
				CMS is up and running.</p>
			<p>But this CMS also allowed me to practice working with Java
				files and creating a Swing user interface, specifically working with
				text fields, radio buttons, comboboxes, list editing, and bilingual
				support.</p>
			<p>
				Eclipse was used for development. The project is located here: <a
					class="link" target="_blank"
					href="https://github.com/weekend-game/weekendcms/">https://github.com/weekend-game/weekendcms/</a>
				(EN) and here: <a class="link" target="_blank"

				(RU).

			<p>The program helps you create HTML website pages in a specific

				To better understand the explanations below, launch the program and
				open the website you created with it. We see that the website
				consists of two types of pages: <a class="link" target="_blank"
					href="https://weekend-game.github.io/">the home page</a> and
				project pages like this one. All project pages are essentially the
				same.

			<p>The project name is displayed in large font in the center. In
				this case, it's my profile name - Weekend Game. If you run the
				program, you'll see that the window that appears contains several
				fields. The "Project Name" field controls what's displayed in the
				center of the home page. At the top of the page is a link to the
				website for projects and a prompt to send emails to my address. It's
				written in English. The bottom section contains similar information,
				but in Russian. The CMS uses the "Website for projects in English",
				"Website for projects in Russian" and "Email" fields to specify all
				of these attributes.</p>
			<p>We can see that above and below the profile name are menu bars
				with links to the pages of each project (repository). The top
				section contains links to the English pages, and the bottom section
				contains links to the Russian pages.</p>

			<p>The project (repository) page list is defined in the CMS under
				the "List of pages" section. These are the project pages. Each page
				has a "Language" setting (EN or RU). This setting determines whether
				the page link will be located at the top or bottom of the homepage.
				Links will be generated in the order they appear in the page list.
				You can change the order using the "Shift up" and "Shift down"
				buttons located to the right of the list. The "Name" field defines
				the page title in natural language, and the "File name" field
				defines the page file name.</p>
			<p>When generating pages, not only the homepage is generated but
				also pages for each row in the page list. Each project page will
				contain a title in large font, taken from the "Name" field. There
				will also be a menu with links to all pages in English or Russian,
				depending on the page attribute. The page will have two menu bars:
				one at the top and one at the bottom. At the very bottom, you will
				see suggestions for visiting project sites and email addresses. The
				page content will be taken from a file with the same name, extracted
				from the folder specified in the "Folder where text files are
				located" field. For example, to generate the page
				weekdayinterpreter.htm, you must not only specify it in the page
				list but also place the weekdayinterpreter description in a file
				with the same name (weekendinterpreter.htm) and place it in the
				folder specified in the "Folder where text files are located" field.
				If such a file is not found, the page weekdayinterpreter.htm will
				still be created, but with only a header and footer.</p>

	</tr>

		<td class="text">
			<p>
				The <b>WeekendCMS</b> class is the main class of the application. It
				contains a static main() method for launching the program. Its
				constructor creates everything necessary for operation.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, the Proper.read() method is called. <b>Proper</b> is a class
				that allows the application to save data between sessions. It saves
				the location and size of the main window, the preferred interface
				language, all information from input fields, and page list data. The
				read() method reads a file with previously saved data. The save()
				method does the opposite: it writes everything stored in the object
				to the file. The setProperty(name, value) method saves the value
				named "name." The getProperty(name, def) method reads the value
				named "name." If it hasn't been written, the value "def" is
				returned. The saveBounds() and setBounds() methods are used to save
				and restore the location and size of the application window.
			</p>
			<p>
				The interface language is then set using the static
				Loc.setLanguage() method. The <b>Loc</b> class is responsible for
				internationalization (I18n). After the language is set, the
				Loc.get() method will return strings in the specified language,
				provided, of course, that the messages_xx.properties localization
				file exists, where xx is the language character.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <b>SiteDescriptor</b> class object is created - an object for
				storing all generated site information. The
				siteDescriptor.readData() method is immediately called on the
				created object. This is where the information is read.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application window is created - an object of the JFrame class.
				The makeJFrame() method is immediately called, in which the user
				interface components are placed within the application window. The
				GBL class is used to place them. <b>GBL</b> is a simplified version
				of the GridBagLayout layout manager, adapted to the needs of the
				application. There are not many user interface components, but their
				creation and configuration require a significant amount of text. To
				simplify matters, everything related to editing the list of pages is
				separated into a separate class: ListEditor. The <b>ListEditor</b>
				object creates a page list editor panel, which can be retrieved
				using the getPanel() method and placed anywhere. Naturally, I'm
				placing it on the only screen of my application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, I initialize the <b>Mes</b> class, which is designed to
				display various messages using dialog boxes. Mes's methods are
				static, which creates a certain coupling between the classes in my
				program. However, I treat it like System.out in Java.
			</p>
			<p>Then I call the readFromSiteDescriptor() method, which
				populates the UI components with the data previously read from
				SiteDescriptor().</p>
			<p>
				The main work is done in the "Generate Pages" button listener. The
				DoIt() method of the <b>Generator</b> class is called. This method
				generates site pages based on the available data.
			</p>
			<p>You can learn more about the program's operation by
				downloading the project, opening it in Eclipse, reading the class
				code, making changes, running the program, and watching the results.</p>
